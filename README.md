# OpenRCT2-Tileman
 Tileman plugin for OpenRCT2

Tileman is a challenge mode in games where you start with a single tile and can't move or build, depending on the game, until you unlock another one through earning enough experience points.

* Buy your first land tiles
* Gain experience and unlock more tiles
* Build more rides and shops to unlock more tiles!
## Installation

Requires OpenRCT2 v0.4.4

1. Download the latest version of the plugin from the [Releases](https://github.com/Haruko/OpenRCT2-Tileman/releases/latest) page.
2. Navigate to the `OpenRCT2/plugin` directory by either:
* Clicking the red toolbox in the main manu and clicking "`Open custom content folder`", then navigating to the `plugins` directory.
* Going directly to `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\OpenRCT2\plugin\` on Windows or equivalent directory on other OSes.
3. If updating from a previous version, delete the existing Tileman JS file.
4. Place the plugin's JS file into the directory and start the game!
